Bloom & Wild exists to celebrate the little things we all do for each other every day. Not just on the big occasions. With them you can be there for the highs. Step up for the lows. Get someone out of a rut. Remember a precious memory. Find the courage to say sorry. Or silly ways to make them smile. After all, unexpected flowers are the best kind. With some companies, care is often packaged up as something cheesy and overly sentimental. But with Bloom & Wild, it goes beyond the clichés, the token gestures, the roses. To them, caring wildly is as thoughtful and beautiful as it is strong and empowering. So whether you’re thanking a friend who moonlights as your unpaid life coach or celebrating a sister who’s really more like a mum. Don’t just send flowers, care wildly",

Whatever your preferred cut – ribeye, fillet, sirloin or perhaps a chateaubriand between two – it'll be as flavoursome and tender as our master butcher intended. Our cellar is brimming with elegant wines to match your meal, with a good selection of reds, whites, rosés and champagnes available by the glass or bottle.

Perhaps the secret to our longevity is that we’ve never stood still. In the last decade alone we’ve taken on the largest hands-on project the RHS has ever tackled by opening the new RHS Garden Bridgewater in Salford, Greater Manchester, and invested in the science that underpins all our work by building RHS Hilltop – The Home of Gardening Science.\nWe have committed to being net positive for nature and people by 2030. We are also committed to being truly inclusive and to reflect all the communities of the UK.\nAcross our five RHS gardens we welcome more than three million visitors each year to enjoy over 34,000 different cultivated plants. Events such as the world famous RHS Chelsea Flower Show, other national shows, our schools and community work, and partnerships such as Britain in Bloom, all spread the shared joy of gardening to wide-reaching audiences.\nThroughout it all we’ve held true to our charitable core – to encourage and improve the science, art, and practice of horticulture –to share the love of gardening and the positive benefits it brings.\nWe are solely funded by our members, visitors, and supporters.",

From our winemakers in the vineyard, to the partners we work with, and of course, our happy customers, it’s all about joyful experiences.\n\nSince launching in 2000, we've sold over 100 million bottles to wine lovers in the UK, offering every style imaginable, catering to all palates and preferences. We've built our range over the years by working hand in hand with talented winemakers across the globe to create and source exclusive wines that are a joy to drink.\n\nWe're on a mission to be the UK's most rewarding wine retailer. To be the feel-good place to get great wine. To bring joy to all our customers.!\n\nEverything we do is driven by what our customers prefer. So instead of selling what we think they'll want, we combine our expertise with their feedback to continuously shape our range of over 700 wines and make more of what they love. It's part of what makes Virgin Wines different - and means that over 90% of our wines are exclusive to us.\n\nOur expert team of award-winning buyers work closely with the best and most exciting independent winemakers around the world, taste testing until they're red in the teeth. We're involved in every stage in the process and have an active role in blending many of our own wines, too. With over 200,000 five-star wine ratings on our website and 16,000 five-star reviews on Trustpilot, we'd like to think we're on the right tracks.\n\nLooking after our customers is so important to us, but we also do our best to care for the planet and ensure everyone in our community is happy and treated fairly. From adopting environmentally friendly practices to supporting charities, our pledge is to have a positive impact on all our surroundings.\n\nWe wouldn't be Virgin if we didn't go the extra mile. Not only have we made ordering wine online easy and enjoyable, we also connect our customers to other Virgin brands. Through us, wine lovers can unlock a world of possibilities, from cruises and luxury hotels to balloon flights and other unforgettable experiences. They can also earn Virgin Red loyalty points when buying our wines, too.",
